## 🛍️ AI-Powered Demand Forecasting Dashboard for Sustainable Retail

### 🌱 Submission for Walmart Sparkathon 2025 (Theme: Creating a Sustainable Future)

---

### 📌 Problem Statement

Retailers often face **inventory losses** due to:

* **Over-purchasing** – leads to waste & higher storage costs
* **Under-purchasing** – results in stockouts, lost sales, and unhappy customers

Fluctuating demand caused by holidays, weather, and weekday patterns makes it difficult to forecast accurately — especially for **perishable goods**.

---

### 🎯 Goal

To develop a **Power BI dashboard prototype** (using synthetic data) that demonstrates how AI-driven demand forecasting can:

* Predict sales trends more accurately
* Help retailers **optimize inventory purchases**
* Reduce food & resource waste
* Improve customer satisfaction and business sustainability

---

### 📊 Dashboard Features

* 📅 **Time-based Analysis**: Daily/Weekly/Monthly demand trends
* 🌤️ **Weather Impact Correlation**: Sales patterns based on synthetic weather data
* 📈 **Holiday/Event Influence**: Highlight demand spikes around festivals
* 🍎 **Product-wise Forecast**: Predictive trends for perishable categories
* 📦 **Inventory Suggestions**: Visual indicators for overstock or understock risk
* 🔁 **Dynamic Filtering**: Based on region, product type, and time

---

### 🧪 Dataset

* **Type**: Synthetic (demo purposes only)
* Fields include:

  * `Product_ID`, `Product_Name`, `Category`, `Date`, `Units_Sold`,
    `Weather_Type`, `Holiday`, `Temperature`, `Demand_Forecast`, etc.
